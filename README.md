# DayZVideos

If you are like me you love watching DayZ videos, but the problem is that we don't have a way to filter them based on categories, duration, views, votes, etc.
DayZVideos comes to solve this problem, enabling visitors to filter videos and users to submit new videos to the app.

* Users system
* Video filters
* Video submission
* Video activation
* Trust system (users need to earn trust points in order to bypass activation)
